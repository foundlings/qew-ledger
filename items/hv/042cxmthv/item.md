Command inventory for `qew draft approve`: release drafts with a human's quoted words.

Flags: --tree, --quote.

End-to-end check (2026-10-08, scratch ledger + local forge fake, scripted run of every command): works, exit codes as documented.

Walk coverage today: 1 direct test invocation(s) of `qew draft approve`; flags never exercised by any test: --tree.

Done when: a golden scenario and the refusal/adversary scenarios for this command and each flag exist as named walks whose docstrings state the failure prevented, and the three documents (help, README, commands spec) agree.
